Summary:
Build a web application with React that fetches data from a Node API which allows a user to lookup information about an IP address and/or Domain. This challenge is comprised of two parts, the fronted React application and the backend Node server.

Minimum Requirements:

· The application(s) are deployed using Docker and running on a service of your choice

· User can submit a domain or IP address into form and data is returned and displayed in the UI

· Use one or more of the WHOIS APIs for accessing IP and domain data

· Frontend is built with React

· Server is built with Node

Bonus Points:

· Wrap WHOIS API(s) in GraphQL \*\*\*

· Typescript

· CI/CD

· Unit Testing

· Good styling, UX, and responsiveness

\*\*\* Tip: See Apollo RESTDataSource

When Finished: Submit links to the repositories and the URL for the web application.

Whois-api lookup is created with REACT, Node.js, and JavaScript. It is deployed and hosted with heroku.

Clone the repo. Either through your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/kassidyb816/whois-api-lookup

In your terminal type:
npm install

In your terminal type:
npm start
